# Installing RHOAI 3 and Dependencies with Kustomize

This repo uses [Kustomize](https://kustomize.io/) to install Red Hat OpenShift AI (RHOAI) 3, its operator dependencies, and the Models-as-a-Service (MaaS) stack in a repeatable, GitOps-friendly way.

## Install Order (Phased Install — Recommended)

Apply overlays **in order** and wait for each phase to be ready before the next. This matches the original manual sequence and avoids race conditions.

| Phase | Overlay | What it does |
|-------|---------|---------------|
| 1 | `overlays/01-operators` | Installs NFD, NVIDIA GPU, Connectivity Link, Leader Worker Set, and RHOAI operators via OLM |
| 2 | `overlays/02-nfd-nvidia-lws-instances` | Creates NFD instance and NVIDIA ClusterPolicy (GPU nodes) and Lead Worker Set Instance |
| 3 | `overlays/03-gateway` | Creates Gatewayclass and Maas Gateway !! UPDATE HOST NAME !! |
| 4 | `overlays/04-rhoai` | Creates DataScienceCluster and Authorinio NetworkPolicy |
| 5 | `overlays/05-odhdashboard` | Updates teh ODH Dashboard Config to enable MaaS and GenAI studio (only for v3.3?) Has to be installed after DSC |
| 6 | `overlays/06-postgres` | Creates Postgres instance for token storage WIP |
| 7 | `overlays/07-maas-controller` | ~~Creates Maas-controller deployment,~~ Policies, RBAC ~~and CRDS~~ (needed for v3.4) |
| 8 | `overlays/08-simulated-models` | Creates dummy models for testing |

Notes:
1. After installation of RHCL (STEP 1):
Make sure csv for rhcl has: - name: ISTIO_GATEWAY_CONTROLLER_NAMES
    value: 'istio.io/gateway-controller,openshift.io/gateway-controller/v1'

2. (After Step 2) Before applying Gateway (STEP 3) UPDATE HOST NAME in gateway yaml.

3. Add annotation to __Kuadrant / rh-connectivity-link ns — service authorinio-authorinio-authorization__

```
annotations:
    service.beta.openshift.io/serving-cert-secret-name: authorino-server-cert
```
Delete `kuadrant-operator-controller` in rhcl namespace, it should come back up with cert.

4. Update Authorino Authorino:

```
  clusterWide: true
  healthz: {}
  listener:
    ports: {}
    tls:
      certSecretRef:
        name: authorino-server-cert
      enabled: true
```

5. After (STEP 6) Postgres DB is installed, view `postgres/maas-api.yaml` and update `maas-api` deployment with postgres details. Update and restart `maas-api` deployment.



### Commands (phased)

```bash
# From repo root
